        You can swapnot sleeping in a penthouse... for not sleeping in a mansion. Whenever you stitch yourself up, you do make a bloody mess.</p>

      <p>Search him. Then I will kill you.</p>

      <p>
        When their enemies were at the gates the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service.</p>

      <p>I'm not wearing hockey pads.</p>

      <p>
        Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion. Eight hundred and forty-nine counts of racketeering. Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud. Eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.Five hundred and twenty-seven counts of obstruction of justice. How do the defendants plead?</p>

        Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck.</p>

        Ooh, you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark, I was born in it. Molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man. By then there was nothing to be but blinded.</p>

      <p>A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.</p>

      <p>Master Wayne, you've been gone a long time. You look very fashionable. Apart from the mud.</p>

      <p>I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.</p>

      <p>They scream and they cry much as you're doing now.</p>

      <p>It's not just your name, sir. It's your father's name. And it's all that's left of him. Don't destroy it.</p>
